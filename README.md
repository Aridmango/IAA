Smart contract for tracking Inter Agency Agreements

The Ethereum contract is a repository of Inter Agency Agreements.
Each Agreement is identified by a unique ID and the parties:
Requesting Agency (RA) and the Servicing Agency (SA).  Both are
identified by their respective Ethereum addresses.  The agreement is a
list of deliverables.  Each deliverable has a description, due date,
payment amount and a state variable.
